# My_restaurant_regression_project
For my first project, I set out to build a model that predicts restaurant ratings based on key features such as votes, cuisine type, Online deliveries & and bookings. I analyzed these factors to uncover patterns and insights that influence customer ratings

Whether weâ€™re selecting a movie to watch, downloading an app, or purchasing a book, one of the first things we check is the rating. A high rating builds trust, while a low one raises doubts. Writers, filmmakers, and developers keenly observe these ratings, knowing they impact success.
The restaurant industry is no different. Customers rely on ratings to decide where to dine, while restaurant owners use them to understand performance and customer satisfaction. Given their significance, what if we could predict restaurant ratings based on various attributes?
